Description

This is a simple module to allow the admin user to turn any textfield, textarea into a simple but very effective
autofill field to explain the users how to fill in the fields. And as the user clicks in the textfield, textarea,
then the help text will simply disappear and allow the user to fill in the information as described. In laymen's
term this module enables admin user to pre-populate a textfield, and textarea with values to describe how users
should fill in the form according to the way that the admin users would like it to be filled in.
eg, link text field: you could add -> http://

The admin user wil be able to use color to describe the default value and prepopulate value color, for better
assistance to the user who has to fill in the form. Admin user will be enabled to fill in the setting page
form (admin/settings/autofill) and save the information in the system. Use a web tool like Firebug etc. to access
the source code and then you'll be able to copy the textfield/textarea class or ID and paste it into the field that
says ID.
But if the admin user don't want to use this method there is a sample.js file that could be saved to anything that
admin user would like.

Call the plugin like so:
Drupal.behaviors.autofill = function(context) {
  $("#edit-field-test-0-value").autofill( {
    value: "Hallo world",
    prePopulate: "Hallo Piet",
    defaultTextColor: "#666666",
    activeTextColor: "#000000",
  }
}

Requirements:

Before installing this module make sure you also download libraries api http://drupal.org/project/libraries
Autofill is depended on the libraries module.

You'll also need to download a third party javascript file created by Mmangino jQuery-AutoFill using git ect.
https://github.com/mmangino/jQuery-AutoFill.git

Installation:

1.Upload the Autofill module in this location sites/all/module/.
2.Enable the module, please make sure the libraries module is also enabled.
3.Create a libraries folder on the sites/all directory in the libraries folder create an autofill folder and add
the jquery.autofill.js in the autofill folder, it should look like this sites/all/libraries/autofill/jquery.autofill.js
4.Go to Admin > Settings > Autofill to access the autofill settings page

Instruction:

On the Autofill page you'll see the following fields:
Default Text color:
Admin user wil be able to choose any color to describe the default text better. This text will disappear when user
clicks in field so it's a good idea to use bright colors to describe what you would like the user to enter.
Active Text Color:
Admin user will use this color option to specify the color of the help text, normally this would be the standard
site text color.
Fill in autofill fields:
1.ID/class: Fill in the id or class of the textfield, textarea you want to autofill (eg. #email-text-area)
2.Empty value: Fill description to describe what the field should be populated with. eg. Please fill in your
email address
3.Pre-populate value:Force users to populate the filed with the correct values, eg. user http:// then user will
be able to add the www.site.com etc.
